## Introduction
`RL-Dominating` is an implementation of the approach described in the paper "Learn to Solve Dominating Set Problem with GNN and Reinforcement Learning". This project combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to efficiently tackle the Dominating Set Problem, a well-known problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for `RL-Dominating`, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amihua/RL-Dominating.git
cd RL-Dominating
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the RL-Dominating algorithm on a sample graph, use the following command:
```commandline
python run.py 
```
Replace 'path/to/graph' with the path to your graph data.
